# 2024-Winter-Arduino-Day3
This is the starter code for all the code exercises.

These files will typically just be the `void setup() {}` and `void loop() {}` functions so if you aren't using the UNSW machines, that'll work fine as well. When trying to upload your code to the arduino, make sure to comment out all your code within the other files as the arduino may complain that you have multiple versions of `void setup` and `void loop` in the same sketchbook (folder).
