The Solution Code for the 2024 Winter Workshop Exercises

If you try to import all the code at once, the code will fail to run as they are all stored in the same folder (sketchbook) and there will be multiple `void setup` and `void loop` functions which can't compile. Because of this, if trying to copy the code, only copy and upload one file.
