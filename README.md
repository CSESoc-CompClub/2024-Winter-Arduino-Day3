# 2024-Winter-Arduino-Day3
The Solution Code for the 2024 Winter Workshop Exercises

If you try to import all the code at once, the code will fail to run as they are all stored in the same folder (sketchbook) and there will be multiple `void setup` and `void loop` functions which can't compile. Because of this, if trying to copy the code, only copy and upload one file.

## Blinking and Fading Lights
There are 3 solutions for the Blinking and Fading lights task. This is just CompClub's implementation of the tasks and there are different ways to approach this task.

The Files are:
- **Blink1.ino**: The original problem
- **Blink2.ino**: Bonus Task 1
- **Blink3.ino**: Bonus Task 2
- **BasicLEDSetup.png**: Example Circuit layout of the LED circuit

## Buttons
There are some sample solutions for the button exercises and also some diagrams for a basic layout for each of the button tasks

The Files are:
- **ButtonTask1Layout.png**: Example Circuit Layout for Task 1
- **ButtonTask2Layout.png**: Example Circuit Layout for Task 2
- **Button1.ino**: Example Code for Bonus Task 1
- **Button2.ino**: Example Code for Bonus Task 2
